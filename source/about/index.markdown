I grew up in York, Pennsylvania and graduated from York College of Pennsylvania in 2012.  My major was Computer Science with a focus in Embedded Systems.  Some of the projects I worked on include:

* Autonomous X80SVP robot - [video of navigation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDzfU6nMj9g)    

* Robust software system for an invented pendulum using [FreeRTOS](http://www.freertos.org/) and a [LPCXpresso](http://ics.nxp.com/lpcxpresso/) microcontroller  

* Java-based simulator for low-power multi-core CPU scheduling  

Upon completion of my B.S., I moved to the Washington, DC area.  I will be starting a M.S. program in the Fall of 2012 at The George Washington University.  My major is Computer Science with a focus in Pervasive Computing and Embedded Systems.  

Recently, I have spent most of my free time reading up on Software as a Service applications using Ruby/Rails.  I started by reading the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/) by Michael Hartl.  Currently, I am taking the free online [SaaS course](https://class.coursera.org/saas-2012-003/class/index) being offered by UC Berkeley.  

My interests outside of Computer Science include: Music, movies, weightlifting, and nutrition.
